# Sarcasm & Non-Literal Detection
This project is a part of the AAI-590 Capstone course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD). 

## Project Description
For this project, we explore sarcasm detection capabilities in various machine learning and deep learning methods.

Our goal is to develop an NLP model to identify sarcasm for assistive tools aimed at neurodivergent individuals.
